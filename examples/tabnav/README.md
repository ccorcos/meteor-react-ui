# To Do

- we want to use any-db so we can separate the subscriptions out on the client.
- so lets try a simple example with foxes and whales and no database
- lets add some nice animations and nice css
- don't forget routing!

- then lets think about how to use any-db with this
  - publish unordered collections
  - publish reactive joins
  - client side subscription cache
