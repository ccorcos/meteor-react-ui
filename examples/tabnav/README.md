# To Do

- in willMount hooks, we must be able to trust that new props will be there.
  - we'll have to pass props as an argument...


- examples:
  - tabnav fox/whale
  - navtab to make sure tabvc update properly


- fix nav pop state
- so lets try a simple example with foxes and whales and no database
- lets add some nice animations and nice css
- don't forget routing!
- refator and clean things up


- then lets think about how to use any-db with this
  - publish unordered collections
  - publish reactive joins
  - client side subscription cache
